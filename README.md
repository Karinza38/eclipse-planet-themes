## :moon: Features at a glance

Three themes are currently available:
* Moon: familiar-looking but not an actual planet. Light-grey, by and large sticks to Eclipse's classic color scheme.
* Neptune: dark blue theme with some red reflections from the distant sun.
* Pluto: not much light reaches this distant dwarf planet, leading to a resolutely dark theme. The presence of purple has yet to be explained by astronomers.

A few words to summarise the planetary ambitions:
* compact: few borders, less visual artifacts, and hidden buttons.
* readable: easy on the eyes with low glare, balanced contrasts and an integrated editor font with programming ligatures.
* outstanding: not a revolution, but hopefully a nice twist to the traditional Eclipse look and feel.

## :cd: Plugin installation

Note that all themes require Eclipse Oxygen (4.7) or more recent.

You can download and install the plugin via the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/planet-themes/), or simply drag the below button to your running Eclipse workspace:

<p align="center">

Alternatively, use the following update site: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyvesB/eclipse-planet-themes/updatesite`. Note that this link will give an error when opened in a browser, but will be handled correctly by Eclipse.

Once installed, open Eclipse's preferences, navigate to `General` -> `Appearance` and select the planet of your choice in the `Theme` dropdown. Restart Eclipse and enjoy your new theme!
